# WELCOME TO MISALLAM'S SPACE

I'm a fellow problem solver with a profound interest in Python, C++, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. With over three years of experience, I'm primarily focusing on leveraging Arabic data to drive innovation and impact accross the MEANS region.

### Professional Experience

Throughout my journey, I've had the privilege to contribute to the AI transformation and product management sectors, working closely with esteemed organizations like **Zedny** and **TAM Development**. My role involved strategizing and implementing cutting-edge AI solutions to address complex challenges, enhancing product capabilities and fostering a culture of technological advancement. I also founded **@Ro2yaLabs** PLEASE GO CHECK!

### Technical Expertise

My technical portfolio spans across various dimensions of artificial intelligence, including but not limited to:

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Contributed to groundbreaking projects such as **[LARA1.5](https://github.com/misallam/LARA-LocalGenAssistant)**, **[GENE](https://github.com/misallam/GENE-CoursesGenerator)**, and **[LUNA](https://github.com/misallam/LUNA-LearningNexusAssessments)**, where I employed advanced NLP techniques to process and analyze Arabic text data efficiently.
- **Automation**: Developed innovative automation solutions like **[FLOW](https://github.com/misallam/FLOW-ContentAutomationAlgorithms )** and **[MIND](https://github.com/misallam/MIND-MultiAspectPsychometricAssessment)** to streamline operations and enhance productivity through intelligent automation.
- **Deep Learning Recommendation Systems**: Invented **[MARS](https://github.com/misallam/MARS-PathwayRecommender)** & **[VIBE](https://github.com/misallam/VIBE-ReelsSegmentRecommender)**, two state-of-the-art deep learning-based recommendation systems, tailored to provide personalized user experiences.
- **Image Processing**: Demonstrated expertise in image processing through my contributions to projects such as **LISY**, **[LARA2.0](https://github.com/misallam/LARA-LocalGenAssistant)**, and the **[Way2Better Model](https://github.com/misallam/W2B-RealTimeGANsAlternative)**, where I leveraged deep learning to enhance image quality and generate realistic images.
- **Text to Audio Conversion**: Actively contributed to the **[ECHO](https://github.com/misallam/ECHO-MultiAccentArabicTTS)** project, where I trained TensorFlowTTS on Saudi Arabic data, significantly advancing the capabilities of text-to-speech technologies in the Arabic language.

### Data Annotation and Dataset Creation

A cornerstone of my work involves the creation of custom, fully annotated datasets encompassing over 100 hours of audio, text, and video content in Egyptian and Saudi Arabic. These datasets have been instrumental in training and fine-tuning AI models, ensuring they are well-equipped to understand and process Arabic data accurately.

### Commitment to AI Transformation

My commitment to AI transformation in the MENA region is driven by a deep-seated belief in the power of data and technology to revolutionize industries, cultures, and societies. By harnessing the potential of AI, particularly in understanding and leveraging Arabic data, I aim to continue contributing to impactful projects and innovations.
